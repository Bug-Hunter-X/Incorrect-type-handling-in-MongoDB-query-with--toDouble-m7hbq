# MongoDB Query Type Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in MongoDB queries involving type handling and the `$toDouble` operator.  The provided code attempts to filter documents based on a numeric comparison, but it fails to properly handle cases where the field being compared is not already a number.

The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.  The problem arises when trying to directly compare a field that may contain strings instead of numbers. The $toDouble operator attempts conversion, but in cases of conversion failures it would throw an error.

## Solution

The solution involves using a more robust approach to type checking and handling within the query itself, avoiding direct comparisons with the potentially erroneous field. 

The solution demonstrates the effective use of aggregation pipeline for reliable handling of potential errors.
